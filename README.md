Spooker, Open Source Game Framework
========================================

#### Making games is a piece of cake with this small library!
Spooker Framework is fully free and open source game library, what will help game developers
in making their own games faster. Spooker is built on top of SFML.NET (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
SFML is cross-platform (running on top of OpenGL) multimedia library, what is really fast and easy to use.
Because of using cross-platform libraries, Spooker is able to run on most platforms, including Windows,
Linux and even Mac.
